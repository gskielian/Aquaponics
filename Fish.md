Notes on Fish
=============

### Koi Carp

### Goldfish

### Minnows

### Feeder Fish

It will take 4 or 5 rounds to get a stable population.

### Tilapia

Iffy whether they would be eatable, in a big environment it would be reasonable, but not possibly with rainwater and 

And would need to have the fish reproduce at enough of the rate.

Smaller fish reproduce faster (reach lower body mass to reach maturity).

Having an environment they can reproduce faster than eat each other is itself a challenge...
